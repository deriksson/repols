= repols: List GitHub repositories filtered by team

repols is a CLI application that lists GitHub repositories and optionally
repository metadata.


== Installation

Create a GitHub personal access token. The application will prompt you
for the value of your token each time you run it.

Issue the following command in the project root:

----
pip install .
----


== Usage

By default, the application simply outputs a list of repository names. The
following command will pipe the list to a file:

----
repols ORGANISATION TEAM > CSV_FILE
----

If the include option is used, the application outputs the fields indicated
by the user instead. The following example, for instance, will display a
list containing the repository names and information on whether the repositories
have been archived.

----
repols  --include name --include archived ORGANISATION TEAM > CSV_FILE
----

Any of the following fields can be included: "archived", "created_at",
"description", "name".
